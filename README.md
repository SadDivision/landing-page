# landing-page
This is where it begins - the landing page.
I relied on the basic layout from the Odin Project,but modified it to my taste.
The project was built with the use of Flex-box.
Added custom fonts, color animations, text animations and gif objects.
Enjoy viewing this one.
P.S. Project is non-profit, but if you have something against the materials used there - write here (aizeckazimov@gmail.com)
